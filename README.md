# Express Auth Example

## Currently a work in progress

This repository serves as an example on how to setup some basic authentication using express and passportjs. The authentication will include a local strategy as well as an OAuth2 strategy using the AUthorization Code Grant flow with Proof Key Code Exchange (PKCE) using Discord as the OAuth2 provider.
